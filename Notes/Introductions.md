# Introductions
## Welcome to the MLND Program
### Program structure
The Machine Learning Nanodegree Program is divided into six parts, giving you a thorough understanding of machine learning, and covering some of the major topics.
#### 1. Machine Learning Foundations
In this section, you'll get an overview of the main algorithms of machine learning. In a few fun bite-sized lectures you'll get to see how they work, and how they get applied to some real life problems. Then, you'll get to test yourself with a mini-project, where you'll learn to detect spam in e-mails based on the text inside the e-mail.

#### 2. Model Evaluation and Validation
In this section, you'll learn the basics of how to build machine learning models. In a nutshell, we'll be answering the following questions:

- How do I train a model?
- How do I know if the model is good?
- How do I improve this model?

First we'll start with teaching you how to train and test models using sklearn. Then, we'll go over the main metrics used for evaluating models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. After that, we'll go over the main problems that a model may have, such as overfitting and underfitting, and we'll learn methods to overcome these difficulties, and to really improve your models.

#### 3. Supervised Learning
Now we're ready to learn the main algorithms of supervised learning. In this section, we'll learn the main ones, including linear and logistic regression, decision trees, naive Bayes, neural networks, and support vector machines. We'll also learn to combine these algorithms to achieve their full potential, in the ensemble methods section. Every section is equipped with a lab, where you'll get to apply your knowledge using sklearn.

#### 4. Deep Learning
You've learned what a neural network is in the Supervised Learning section. In this section we'll go even deeper, and study convolutional neural networks, and their applications in image recognition. Other cutting-edge techniques such as transfer learning will be studied, so you'll be at the forefront of the technology!

#### 5. Unsupervised Learning
In this section we'll be going over the main unsupervised learning algorithms, including several clustering methods, and dimensionality reduction. You'll go through several mini-projects and labs in which you'll be able to apply these concepts with real data.

#### 6. Reinforcement Learning
Some actions, such as teaching a robot how to walk, or how to play chess, require much more than a supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm. They require the agent to interact with an environment repeatedly and learn from its experiences. This is what reinforcement learning is about. In this section you'll learn how to implement different reinforcement learning algorithms, and apply them to a variety of tasks such as navigating a cab in an environment, or playing atari games. Then we'll go into the cutting edge algorithms like deep Q-networks or policy gradients, to learn much more complex tasks such as controlling a quadcopter in the air.

### Projects

#### 1. Introductory Project: Exploring the Titanic Survival Data
In this project you'll use Pandas and Numpy to analyze a real dataset of passengers on the Titanic. Based on this information, you'll be able to predict their survival.

#### 2. Model Evaluation Validation: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
You'll use scikit learn and regression to analyze a real dataset of housing prices in boston. You'll build and optimize a model to predict the price of houses, based on their features.

#### 3. Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML
Your task will be to build a classification model to identify the best potential donors for a charity. You'll be able to use several classification algorithms and optimize them for quality.

#### 4. Deep Learning: Dog Breed Recognition Project
In this project you will use Keras to build a convolutional neural network to recognize dog breeds from images. Furthermore, if an image of a human is provided, the algorithm will guess which breed of dog looks the most like that human. You'll also be able to improve your results significantly by using pre-trained networks.

#### 5. Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments
You will study a real dataset of customers for a company, and you'll apply several unsupervised learning techniques in order to extract valuable information from this data.

#### 6. Reinforcement Learning: Teach a Quadcopter to Fly
In this project you'll use deep reinforcement learning to design a simulated quadcopter that learns to take off, hover, and land, all by itself. As a bonus, you'll be able to integrate these behaviors into a single end-to-end system, that can autonomously fly from point A to point B

#### 7. Capstone Project
This is your turn to shine! In this project you'll be able to distinguish yourself by building a machine learning to solve a problem that you are passionate about, using any dataset of your choice. Our network of expert reviewers will guide you through your proposal phase, and will give you solid feedback on your model, your data, and your procedure.

## Readiness
The main two requirements for this program, are math and coding. We will normally introduce what we need in classs, but if you need to brush up, we recommend the following free courses at Udacity:
- [Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036)
- [Probability and Statistics](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101)
- [Linear Algebra](https://eu.udacity.com/course/linear-algebra-refresher-course--ud953)

Also, Khan Academy has great resources in [Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library), [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus), and [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra), which we invite you to check as well.

Such content is optional and shouldn't prevent you from doing the projects. However, it is encouraged for a theoretical understanding.
