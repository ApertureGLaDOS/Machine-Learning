## Introduction to Machine Learning
1. Decision Trees
2. Naive Bayes
3. Gradient Descent (each step, choose the most benifit one)
4. Linear Regression
5. Logistic Regression
6. Support Vector Machines
7. Neural Networks
8. Kernel Method
9. K-means Clustering (known number of clusters)
10. Hierarchical Clustering (Number of cluster is unknown)

## Introductory Practice Project 
### Project Overview
In this practice project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.

In addition, you'll make sure Python is installed with the necessary packages to complete this project. There are two Python libraries, **numpy** and **pandas**, that we'll use a bit here in this project. Don't worry about how these libraries work for now — we'll get to them in more detail in later projects. This project will also familiarize you with the submission process for the projects that you will be completing as part of the Nanodegree program.
